# guacamole

SENG 513 group project (codename guacamole)

## how to get started

1. install Docker
2. install node
   - in project folder, run "npm install"
3. run the project `docker-compose up -d`
   - this will start the Docker multi-container
   - open up Docker Desktop.
   - once the guacamole container pops up in "Containers", the app is all ready to go!
   - you can go to http://localhost:3000 to see the default page
   - I've also written a page that has a preview of what the chess board might look like: http://localhost:3000/match

next-auth is working, but you must add your own secret for next-auth in a .env.local file. for example mine is:
```
GITHUB_ID=<secret>
GITHUB_SECRET=<secret>

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/myapp
```

## from next.js readme

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
